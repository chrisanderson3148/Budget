    The old format of the Credit Union output files of the C# budget program was the same as the
    download files and included many fields that are not used in budget calculations. This wasted
    time and space. More troublesome was that the output files did not include the calculated budget
    category.  This meant that the budget had to be looked up for almost EVERY RECORD in EVERY FILE,
    EVERY TIME the files were read in.  This was a HUGE performance hit. The new files (for backup
    purposes) will have a different format: only the fields that are used will be saved, including
    the budget category. The only time the budget category will have to be looked up is when the
    download file is first processed to be added to the DATABASE.

    # There are many differences in the file format for CU after 1/25/2016.
    # All fields are book-ended by double-quotes
    #    Transaction ID: is a space-delimited field consisting of:
    #        Posting date (YYYYMMDD)
    #        454292 just those 6 digits, don't know what they are or if they will change in the
    #          future.
    #        Amount in pennies (absolute value, with commas every third digit)
    #        4 groups of three digits comma-delimited, eg, 201,601,088,564
    #            The 12 digits when concatenated are taken to be the Post
    #            Date as YYYYMMDD and old-format Transaction_ID minus the leading 'ID'.
    #            For example, 201,601,088,564 from above are combined together: 201601088564 and are
    #              interpreted as YYYYMMDDIIII, or '1/8/2016', 'ID8564'
    #    Posting Date: as M/D/YYYY
    #    Effective Date: as M/D/YYYY
    #    Transaction Type: as Debit, Credit, Check
    #    Amount: as [-]d+\.ddddd
    #    Check Number: (empty if Transaction Type is not Check)
    #    Reference Number: 9-digit, appears to be a unique number which decrements by one for every
    #      new transaction
    #    Description: Details of who
    #    Transaction Category: Mostly empty, but sometimes has a budget category (bank-assigned)
    #    Type: Debit Card, ACH, Withdrawal, Transfer, sometimes empty
    #    Balance: Amount remaining in checking account
    # The difference between the monthly file formats for CU between Mar2006 and Apr2006, is the
    #   later dates added two fields
